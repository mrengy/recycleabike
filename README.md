# Running Locally
We use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) for fancy things that SASS provides, and we compile it to CSS locally. 

Edit code in the .scss file rather than editing .css files directly.

To build the debug CSS and minified CSS, run `make` from the command line in the neve-child directory.
To "watch" the minified CSS, run `make watch` from the command line in the neve-child directory.
